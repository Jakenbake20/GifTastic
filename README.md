# GifTastic

In this assignment for my University of Utah Coding Program I created a Superhero Gif Search.
I used a GIPHY API and AJAX so users can populate gifs of their favorite superheroes while being able to pause and play them.

# # How to use it

It's simple! Use the three superheroes I have picked out to test it out. Then you can enter whatever superhero you'd like into the search bar and press submit. Then a new button will appear. After clicking your new button 10 new gifs will replace any gifs already populated. You can play and pause these gifs by clicking them.
